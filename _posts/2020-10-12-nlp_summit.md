# NLP Summit 2020

I want to kick off this blog by describing my impressions and take-aways from attending the [NLP Summit 2020: Applied Natural Language Processing](https://www.nlpsummit.org/) which took place virtually between October 6th and 9th. [John Snow Labs](https://www.johnsnowlabs.com/), the main creator behind [Spark NLP](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp) and organizer of the summit put together a diverse and interesting program for the four conference days.

Overall I really enjoyed the conference. I especially liked the focus on *applied* NLP, presenting many specific NLP use cases from industry as well as topics such as product management, model deployment and data annotation. Working myself at the intersection of applied NLP research, data science and engineering, I recognized many common pain points and lessons learned from my own experience during the conference. Please note that this blog post only describes my own experience and doesn't give a full picture of the conference. Even though I tried to attend as many sessions as possible, I am sure that I still missed some great talks. 

## The state of Applied NLP in 2020

The field of applied NLP has made tremendous progress over the last couple of years and continues to grow. Not only are academic benchmarks being beaten at a regular rate, but companies are also increasingly applying these new technologies to their use cases. The field is still very young, with only a minority of companies having NLP models in production for more than five years. However, companies are investing. According to the [2020 NLP Survey Report](https://gradientflow.com/2020nlpsurvey/) by Ben Lorica and Paco Nathan, "53% of respondents who are Technical Leaders stated their NLP budget was at least 10% higher compared to 2019". 

When it comes to specific use cases, document classification, named entity recognition and sentiment analysis are still the most popular NLP tasks. Given the sheer amount of text documents that companies are processing on a daily basis and the recent rate of improvement of NLP techniques, I believe that we will see an enourmous demand for NLP tools, platforms, engineers and researchers in the coming years. Cl√©ment Delangue, CEO at [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/), even went so far as giving a keynote titled "NLP is going to be the most transformational tech of the decade!", basing this claim on the fact that most of our day, both at work and in private, is spent using natural language, which finally can be  accurately processed by machines thanks to recent improvements. 

Just to mention a few of the many exciting use cases that were presented at the conference:
