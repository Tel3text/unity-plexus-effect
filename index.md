Hello and welcome to my blog! 

There are many good reasons to start your own blog: Improving your technical writing skills, sharing what you have learned with the community or showcasing your work to potential employers, clients or collaborators. I highly recommend the article [Why you (yes, you) should blog](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045) by Rachel Thomas that motivated me to start my own blog. 

On this blog I want to share personal projects covering data science, machine learning and natural language processing, as well as thoughts on topics such as AI project management, data ethics and how AI affects the economy and society.
